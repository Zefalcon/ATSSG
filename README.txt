Our code is a simple turn-based strategy game. 
It requires no outside requirements to run, so as long as you have Java, it will run. 
You just need to run the main method in the Game class.
We have basic framework in place for the GUI, map, Units, and AI among iother things.
The units on the left are controlled by the player and if you click on them you can select action from the lower menu.
Upon ending your turn with the N button in the upper left, the player actions will execute, followed by the AI.
